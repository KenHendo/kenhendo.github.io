### A list of projects I'm currently working on, books I'm reading and technology I'm investigating.

* Preparing for the newly released AZ-102 Azure upgrade exam.
* Deploying an example CI/CD pipeline using Gradle, Jenkins and Docker within Azure.
* Refactoring a lot of my old PowerShell code into a new general tools module.  This gives me an excuse to practice an element of test driven development via Pester.
* Building C# skills by deploying some small asp.net projects.
* Reading: "Site Reliability Engineering", "The Site Reliability Workbook", "The Phoenix Project".

Plenty of stuff there to keep me out of trouble for a while (I hope...).

I'm always on the lookout for recommendations of good tech training resources, so if you know of any you'd like to share please let me know. :-)
