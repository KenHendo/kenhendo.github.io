title: AZ-102 | A better exam than 70-533
---
I sat AZ-102 today and upgraded to the new Azure Administrator Associate cert.

In terms of difficulty and depth of questions, I'd day that this exam was on-par with 70-533.  It improves on 533 in that the 102 exam has a much tighter focus around fewer topics, but it goes into greater depth on the areas that are covered.  There were definitely one or two questions in there that stumped me - and these were on areas that I considered my strongest!

Microsoft seems to be continuing the move away from the older style multi-choice questions and utilising more case studies.  I've read that some candidates have encountered practical exercises that are spun up in Azure; I wasn't presented with any, although the pre-exam intro text did seem to suggest that these could be expected.

Some advice for anyone planning to sit AZ-100, AZ-101 or AZ-102 :-

* It goes without saying (but I'm saying it anyway...) that you absolutely must have access to some sort of non-production Subscription that you can use build out and tear-down various demo labs as you work through the objective. Just keep an eye on your monthly costs - I ate through almost all of my Â£75 MPN credit even though I *tried* to remember to clean up and auto-shutdown VMs etc.
* The best learning resource by far is the repository of official Azure docs.  Take full advantage of them, work throught the relevant ones for each of the exam objectives and make sure you complete the various exercises.  Understand the PowerShell / ARM Template / Azure CLI code examples.  The only reason I was able to answer a couple of questions was because of some obscure fact from the official docs.
* Check out [www.getazureready.com](https://www.getazureready.com/) for some really comprehensive (and free!) courses on most of the new AZ- exams, including AZ-100 & AZ-101.
* Another free online course specifically for AZ-102 is at [lynda.com](https://www.lynda.com/Azure-tutorials/Cert-Prep-Microsoft-Azure-Administrator-Certification-Transition-Exam-AZ-102/761948-2.html) . This one is only meant to be an overview of the various objectives, but I found it useful as a short refresher.

So a fairly challenging exam, but unlike 70-533 it doesn't try to cover an unreasonably wide number of areas.
