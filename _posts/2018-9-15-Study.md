I've been working though a backlog of a few PowerShell resources lately since I finished up studying for [70-533](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-70-533.aspx).

* [PowerShell Scripting in a Month of Lunches](https://www.manning.com/books/learn-powershell-scripting-in-a-month-of-lunches)
* [The PowerShell Scripting and Toolmaking Book](https://leanpub.com/powershell-scripting-toolmaking)
* [Become Hardcore Extreme Black Belt PowerShell Ninja Rockstar](https://leanpub.com/become-powershell)
* [The Pester Book](https://leanpub.com/pesterbook)
* [Microsoft Virtual Academy: Testing with Pester](https://mva.microsoft.com/en-us/training-courses/testing-powershell-with-pester-17650)

In most roles I find myself writing a lot of variations on the same core types of scripts (usually Active Directory related). That repetition is good for embedding knowledge in those areas, but the downside is that there are often some cool new features that appear in the PowerShell landscape that initially pass me by.

I'm a big fan of The â€˜Month of Lunches' books - they are always my go to recommendations for anyone who asks how to start picking up PowerShell. It's been a few years since I read 'PowerShell Toolmaking in a Month of Lunches', so its successor seemed like a good place to start for a refresher.

'The PowerShell Scripting and Toolmaking Book' follows directly on from that and both have been excellent reads.

In the process of working through these books, I noted which areas I wanted to dig further into to some extent. Some of these are fairly new to me (I've only now getting fully up to speed with Plaster,Pester and Platyps for example).

Importantly, I think, I've also picked up some ideas of how to better design and structure my code.

The next step is to put together a new module that I can use as a test case for each of these things in turn: scaffolding it via custom Plaster templates, designing and developing unit test first etc.

I've found that in order to make any new study *really* stick, it's necessary to actually *do that thing* and not just read and nod!
