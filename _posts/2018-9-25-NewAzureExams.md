## Details of the new AZ- exams released

As is now tradition, Microsoft have just announced various changes to the various Azure certifications at Ignite.


First and foremost, the current Azure exams such as 70-533, and the MCSA / MCSE tracks that they contribute to, are being retired at the end of December 2018.  The retired certifications are:-

* MCSA: Cloud Platform
* MCSA: Azure on Linux
* MCSE: Cloud Platform & Infrastructure.

The 70-xxx series of exams have been replaced with AZ-xxx ones that intend to more closely match specific Azure job roles as defined by Microsoft.  The new paths now available, via beta exams, are:-

* Microsoft Certified Azure Administrator
* Microsoft Certified Azure Developer
* Microsoft Certified Azure Solutions Architect

A further three Azure tracks will be added to that list in the next few months:-

* Microsoft Certified: Azure DevOps Engineer Expert
* Microsoft 365 Certified: Enterprise Administrator Expert
* Microsoft 365 Certified: Modern Desktop Administrator Associate

### So what does this mean?

If you have not yet started on the path to Azure certification, then the message is clear: start with the new exams for one of the role-based Azure certifications.

However, if you already hold one of the previous Azure certifications, then there are new "Transition" exams available.  This appears to be a bit of a departure from the usual *Upgrade* exams that you may be familiar with, in that the transition exams claim not to test you on subject areas that were part of the objectives for the relevant legacy exam.  A quick look at the objectives for AZ-102, which transitions from 70-533, seems to confirm just that; it's much more tightly focused on the delta subject areas only.

Expect to see more of this "Role Based" aproach to Microsoft certification going forward across different technologies, such as SQL, Core infrastructure etc.

### Initial Thoughts

Honestly?  My first response was a groan.  After passing 70-533 earlier in the year, I'd deliberately held off further Azure certification until Ignite and a clearer indication from Microsoft of their Cloud certification plans.

The thought of undertaking AZ-102 to upgrade to the 'Microsoft Certified Azure Administrator' doesn't particularly fit into my current learning plans.  

*However...*

The new 'Microsoft Certified Azure Developer' track fairly well matches my immediate study goals. Beyond that, the yet-to-be-released 'Microsoft Certified: Azure DevOps Engineer Expert' certificate has caught my eye.  Depending on the content, I suspect my new Azure study path looks like: -

1. **AZ-200** - Microsoft Azure Developer Core Solutions Exam
2. **AZ-201** - Microsoft Azure Developer Advanced Solutions Exam
3. The unreleased final exam(s) for **'Microsoft Certified: Azure DevOps Engineer Expert'**  

Grumbling about transition paths aside, this generally seems like the right move from MS.  A move away from certification exams focused on individual technologies to ones that map to specific, real world job roles seems far more useful; done right, it should more effectively prepare candidates for the duties they'd be expected to undertake in an actual job.
