I figured I needed a bit of a break from working on my current Pester, Plaster and general PowerShell studies so set up this personal GitHub page.  One immediate plus - it gets me into the habit of quickly writing updates via Markdown.

So far so good.  I'm more used to WordPress than Jekyll, but being able to quickly bash out a quick post via a local repo while I'm already in working VScode is very appealing.

There's the necessary DNS jiggery-pokery done as well so that I can now use this as a default web presence.
