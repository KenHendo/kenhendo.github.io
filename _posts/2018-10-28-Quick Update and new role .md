title: A busy few weeks
---

The last few weeks haven't given me much time to post anything new as I've been working on securing a new contract, with all that entails, and continuing to study for the AZ-102 exam.

I'll be starting a new role as a [Site Reliability Engineer](https://landing.google.com/sre/) for a new financial client shortly and am really looking forward to it.  It should be a great opportunity to work more heavily with Azure and dive into other new (to me) technologies.

One thing I noticed today was that the [AZ-400 objectives](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-az-400.aspx) are available and the beta exam is available to book.  I'll post more on that later after having a bit of a read through what is included; at first glance it looks really good.
